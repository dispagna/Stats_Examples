# Stats Examples

As I'm working on M.S. in Statistics through TAMU, sometimes it helps me to work through examples that have nothing to do with a specific homework assignment.  In some cases, I'm just trying to better understand a specific concept.  In other cases, I want to better understand how to use the associated R functions.  So this repository is kind of a mish-mash of R analysis examples.
